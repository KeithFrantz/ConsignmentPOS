This program is meant to support a single user setting up, running, and settling up after a "white elephant" sale, which is a consignment sale for unwanted items.
The items are sold at a flat commission, with unsold items and the net sales proceeds being returned to their original owners during or after the end of the sale.
This type of sale is usually conducted to raise funds for an organization, and the people supplying the items for sale are typically members of that organization.
This program was first used at the 2023 convention of the Mid-Eastern Region of the National Model Railroad Association in Altoona, PA.
It is written in C# using a Windows Forms for the user interface, and SQL Express as the backend database, and Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 as the development environment.
Documentation (initially) resides in a single .docx file and was written using WordPad.
